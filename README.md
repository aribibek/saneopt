# saneopt 
A C command line option parser. Named `saneopt`, because, as opposed to `getopt`
it's actually mostly sane.

## API
API is documented in [`include/saneopt.h`](https://github.com/mmalecki/saneopt/blob/master/include/saneopt.h)
and heavily used in tests.

## Usage
Executing `make` in the project tree results in a `libsaneopt.a` to be created.
You can link this library statically to your project.
